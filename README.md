# oss-codesign
An open source software co-design project

## About
As open source software (OSS) teams become increasingly asynchronous, there are significant challenges with properly accounting for usability concerns for the human end users. Co-design, where multiple stakeholders for an OSS come together to work on the design of a project iteratively, is one way that usability concerns can be addressed throughout a project's lifespan. However, many OSS teams choose to focus on code and functionality rather than incorporating co-design methods. Moreover, when OSS teams are able to include end users in co-design methods, there are countless barriers encountered. Here you will find links to sketches and the Framer prototype following the first few rounds of iterative design.

## Framer
The interactive high-fidelity computer prototype can be found [here](https://framer.com/share/github-co-design--fXFzZ0bF0G47aCZMQoDg/sqgMqrw4L).

## Sketches
The sketches, using the 10 Plus 10 method, can be viewed here.
